Issues
======

This is a public issue-tracking repository for bugs and confirmed features related to the Overcast Network.

### Important:

If you find a potential exploit or vulnerability, please exercise reasonable disclosure:

1. Privately [contact Overcast Network staff](mailto:support@oc.tc?subject=Important%20security%20vulnerability) about the issue.
2. **Do not** publicly disclose the issue immediately (give Overcast Network staff adequate time to respond to and address your inquiry before you disclose the vulnerability publicly).

## Submitting

Issues can be [submitted](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/Issues/issues/new) at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/Issues/issues).

### Do:

* Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate
* Verify the validity and/or plausibility of your issue
* Be clear and concise in your description
* Take advantage of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)--it's awesome, and it makes your submission that much better! :smile:

### Do not:

* Bump issues to receive a response (all issues are acknowledged)
* Argue unproductively in an issue's comments
* Re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed
* Add comments such as :+1:, +1 or "I like this idea"
* Submit map-related issues
* Submit issues that are general suggestions, as opposed to *specific, technical* bugs or *confirmed* features

## Formatting

It is recommended that issues are formatted using the following template for maximum clarity and readability:

### Title

Provide a brief summary of the issue. Your title should allow users browsing the tracker to grasp the gist of your issue at a glance.

**Example**:

> Avatars not displaying correctly in friends list

### Description

Try to separate your description into three different sections, if possible:

1. **The issue**

    This section should provide a detailed explanation of the issue.

2. **Steps to reproduce**

    If applicable, this section should provide a detailed list of steps needed to reproduce the issue.

3. **Miscellaneous information**

    Information that doesn't necessarily fit into any other sections. Common examples are attachments, images, or disclaimers.


## Weeklies

'Weeklies' are issue tracker milestones created by Overcast Network staff each weekend. Issues slated to be resolved on any given weekend are assigned to that weekend's relative milestone, so that progress on the weekend's issues can be easily visualized.

**Overcast Network Weeklies can be found [here](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/Issues/issues/milestones).**

Overcast Network utilizes [Bountysource](http://www.bountysource.com/trackers/141483-overcast-network-issues) to support the crowd-funding of issue completion.

### How?

1. A user creates an issue
2. A bounty creation link is automatically added to the bottom of the issue
3. Any supporters of the issue can add cash ***bounties*** to the issue
4. Outside developers can submit their own ***solutions*** to the issue
5. When the issue is resolved, the developer responsible (whether an internal or external developer) receives the bounties

### Why?

* **Incentivizes issue resolution**

    Developers are motivated to solve issues.
* **Provides extra financial support for developers**

    Programming for a large-scale production environment isn't an average 9-to-5 job.
* **Shows which issues are most important to users**

    Users have a powerful platform for voicing their desires.
* **Encourages external developer interaction**

    Outside developers can earn bounties with their solutions, too.
